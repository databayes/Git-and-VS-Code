# Staging Only the Changes You Intend – The Calm Way to Use Git

Up to now, we’ve created files, previewed Markdown, committed changes, and pushed them safely.

At some point, though, you’ll notice something important:

> You don’t always want to commit *everything* you’ve changed.

This post explains **staging only the changes you intend** — one of the most powerful (and calming) Git habits you can build.

## The key idea (plain English)

Editing a file does **not** mean committing it.

Git gives you an extra step in between:

- **Changes** → everything you’ve edited
- **Staged Changes** → what you *choose* to commit

Staging is how you tell Git:

> “Commit *this*, but not *that*.”

---

## Why this matters (especially for writing)

When writing blog posts or documentation, you often:

- Fix a typo
- Add a new section
- Tweak formatting
- Leave rough notes for later

You don’t want all of that frozen into one commit.

Selective staging lets you:
- Commit one logical idea at a time
- Keep your history readable
- Avoid the “everything changed” commits

**My view:**  
Staging is what turns Git from a backup tool into a **thinking tool**.

---

## Step 1: Make your changes normally

- Edit your Markdown files in VS Code
- Save (`Ctrl + S`)

At this point:
- Git sees *all* your edits
- Nothing is committed yet

---

## Step 2: Open Source Control

- Click the **Source Control** icon (branch symbol)

You’ll see files listed under **Changes**.

Git is saying:
> “These files are different from the last commit.”

---

## Step 3: Stage a whole file (the simple case)

Use this when:
- Everything in the file belongs together

How:
- Click the **`+`** next to the file name

Result:
- The file moves to **Staged Changes**
- Only staged files will be included in the commit

---

## Step 4: Stage *part* of a file (the powerful bit)

Use this when:
- You edited multiple sections
- But only want to commit *some* of them

How:
1. Click the file name to open the **diff view**
2. You’ll see:
   - **Red** = removed or changed lines
   - **Green** = added lines
3. Hover over a green block
4. Click **Stage Selection**

Only that section is now staged.

Everything else stays under **Changes**.

---

## Step 5: Check what’s staged (always do this)

Before committing, pause and check:

- **Staged Changes** → what *will* be committed
- **Changes** → what will *not*

This one glance prevents most mistakes.

---

## Step 6: Commit with confidence

- Write a commit message that matches *only what’s staged*
- Click **Commit**

You’ve now created a clean, intentional snapshot.

Everything unstaged is still there, ready for a later commit.

---

## A simple mental model

- **Changes** = work in progress
- **Staged Changes** = chosen work
- **Commit** = snapshot of chosen work only

Git never commits anything you haven’t staged.

---

## Common mistakes (and how to avoid them)

- **Committing too much**
  - Fix: stage one idea at a time
- **Vague commit messages**
  - Fix: message should describe *only what’s staged*
- **Forgetting to check staged changes**
  - Fix: always glance before committing

---

## Final takeaway

You don’t commit files.  
You commit **intentional changes**.

Staging is how you tell Git what those intentions are.

Once you start using selective staging, Git becomes calmer, clearer, and far more useful.
