# Git vs GitHub – Plain English for Data & Analytics People

If you work in data, analytics, Power BI, Fabric, or Python notebooks, you *will* hear people talk about **Git** and **GitHub**. They’re often used interchangeably — but they are **not** the same thing.

This post explains the difference clearly, without developer jargon.

## What is **Git**?

**Git** is a **version control tool**.

- Installed **locally** on your machine  
- Tracks **changes to files over time**  
- Lets you:
  - Save versions (**commits**)
  - Go back in time
  - Create parallel lines of work (**branches**)
- Works **offline** — no internet required  

**Summary:** Git is the *engine*. Powerful, reliable, and slightly unfriendly if you’re new.

---

## What is **GitHub**?

**GitHub** is a **cloud platform** that hosts Git repositories.

- Built **on top of Git**
- Stores your code and files online
- Adds collaboration features:
  - Shared repositories
  - Pull requests
  - Comments and reviews
  - Issues and task tracking
  - CI/CD and automation hooks
- Requires an internet connection  

**Summary:** GitHub is where Git becomes usable for teams and professionals.

## The key relationship (this really matters)

- **Git** = tracks changes  
- **GitHub** = shares changes  

You can:

- Use **Git without GitHub** (everything stays local)
- ❌ You *cannot* use GitHub without Git  

Think of GitHub as a **service built around Git**, not a replacement for it.

## A data & Power BI analogy

What does this equate to:

- **Git** → version history in Power BI Desktop or Tabular Editor  
- **GitHub** → OneDrive + comments + approvals + deployment pipeline  

Git tracks *what changed*. GitHub helps people **review, approve, and deploy** those changes safely.

---

## When should you care?

**Solo work**

- Git alone *can* be enough
- Useful for:
  - Notebooks
  - Scripts
  - Experiments  

**Professional or shared work**

- GitHub is effectively **non-negotiable**
- Especially important for:
  - PBIP projects
  - Fabric notebooks
  - Reusable code
  - Governance and auditability

---

## Final takeaway

- Learn **Git** to control your work  
- Use **GitHub** to collaborate and work like a professional team  

Once you’ve used both properly, you won’t want to go back.
