# Why Git Can’t See Your Changes (Until You Save)

At some point when using Git with VS Code, almost everyone hits this moment ( I just did, hence this blog post):

> “I’ve changed the file… why can’t Git see it?”

Nothing is broken.  
You haven’t lost anything.  
You probably just forgot to **save**.

This post explains *why* that happens — and why it’s actually a good thing.

## The moment this usually happens

You’re editing a file in VS Code.

- You add a new section
- You tweak a paragraph
- You expect to stage just that change

But when you open **Source Control**:
- Nothing shows up
- No diff view
- No “Stage Selection”

It feels like Git is ignoring you.

---

## What Git actually tracks (this is the key)

Git does **not** track what’s on your screen.

Git tracks:
- **files written to disk**

Until you save:
- The file exists only in memory
- Git has nothing stable to compare against

From Git’s point of view:
> “There is no change yet.”

## VS Code vs Git (different responsibilities)

This confusion comes from mixing two roles:

- **VS Code** lets you:
  - type freely
  - experiment
  - undo
- **Git** only works with:
  - saved files
  - known states
  - deliberate snapshots

They are doing different jobs.

---

## Why this is actually a good design

Git *could* try to track every keystroke.

It doesn’t — deliberately.

Because:
- Unsaved changes are often half-formed
- You might undo them
- You might not want them recorded

By waiting for a save, Git ensures:
- changes are intentional
- diffs are meaningful
- history stays clean

**My view:**  
This is Git protecting you, not ignoring you.

## The invisible rule to remember

> **If it isn’t saved, it doesn’t exist (to Git).**

Once you remember that rule, a lot of Git behaviour suddenly makes sense.

---

## The calm workflow that always works

Before asking anything of Git:

1. **Save** (`Ctrl + S`)
2. Open **Source Control**
3. Click the file to view the diff
4. Stage intentionally
5. Commit

If something “isn’t showing up”, step 1 usually fixes it.

## A common follow-up question

> *What about Auto Save?*

Auto Save can work, but for beginners it can:
- hide the moment Git notices a change
- make cause and effect less obvious

For learning Git, I recommend:
- **manual saves**
- clear, deliberate steps

Once the mental model is solid, Auto Save is fine.

---

## Final takeaway

Git isn’t watching you type.

It’s waiting for you to say:
> “This version matters.”

Saving the file is how you say that.

Once you internalise this, Git becomes predictable, calm, and trustworthy.
