# Branching Out: Git & VS Code for Power BI Practitioners

This repository supports a series of blog posts, demos, and hands-on examples designed to help **Power BI practitioners** understand and adopt **source control and DevOps practices** in a calm, practical, and accessible way.

The focus is not on “developer purity”, but on **real-world workflows** that analysts, report developers, and Fabric users can actually use.

---

## Why this repo exists

Git, GitHub, and DevOps concepts are often explained from a **software engineering** perspective.

For people working with:
- Power BI
- Microsoft Fabric
- Notebooks
- Semantic models (PBIP)
- Documentation and blog content

…the explanations are often either:
- too abstract,
- too intimidating, or
- too focused on tooling rather than *understanding*.

This repo exists to bridge that gap.

---

## What you’ll find here

- Markdown blog posts (`.md`) explaining Git concepts in plain English
- Step-by-step workflows using **Visual Studio Code**
- Examples that mirror how Power BI and Fabric practitioners actually work
- Git history that is intentionally kept **readable and instructional**

This repo is as much a **learning artefact** as it is a content repository.

## How this ties in with *Branching Out*

This work directly ties into the **Branching Out** series, a collaboration between:

- **Mathias Thierbach**  
  Power BI MVP and creator of **pbi-tools**, with deep expertise in Tabular models, TMDL, and professional Power BI development  
  🔗 https://www.linkedin.com/in/mthierba/

- **Sue Bayes**  
  Power BI & Fabric specialist focused on making advanced data practices accessible to practitioners  
  🔗 https://www.linkedin.com/in/suebayes/

Together, the goal of *Branching Out* is to:
- Demystify Git, branching, and source control
- Show how these practices apply to **Power BI and Fabric**, not just code
- Help people move from fear to confidence through **understanding**

## Who this is for

This repository is aimed at:

- Power BI developers who want to use Git without becoming “developers”
- Fabric users working with notebooks, Lakehouses, and semantic models
- Analysts who write documentation, blogs, or training material
- Anyone curious about DevOps practices but put off by jargon

If you can use Power BI Desktop, you can use what’s in this repo.

---

## How to use this repo

A simple suggested flow:

1. Read the blog posts in order
2. Open the repo in **Visual Studio Code**
3. Observe the Git history alongside the content
4. Use the workflows here as a template for your own work

You’re encouraged to:
- clone it
- experiment
- break things safely
- learn by doing

---

## Guiding principles

- Plain English over jargon
- Understanding before automation
- Small, intentional commits
- Calm, inspectable workflows
- Git as a *thinking tool*, not just a backup tool

---

## Final note

This repository is intentionally opinionated.

It reflects how **data practitioners actually work**, not how textbooks say they should work.

If it helps you feel more confident using Git with Power BI and Fabric, it’s doing its job.
