# From New File to Git Commit – What Actually Happens (Step by Step)

So you’ve written **Blog Post 3** in VS Code. Now what?

This post explains what’s happening behind the scenes, and the exact actions to take so your work is safely saved in **Git** (and ready to push to GitHub if you want).

---

## The short version (the workflow)

- Create or edit a file
- Save it locally
- Preview it (sanity check)
- Stage it (tell Git “include this”)
- Commit it (create a snapshot)
- Push it (optional: send snapshot to GitHub)

That’s the whole loop.

---

## Step 1: Create your new file in VS Code

Example: Blog post 3.

- In VS Code, in the Explorer panel:
  - Click **New File**
  - Name it something predictable, for example:  
    `vscode-git-how-they-talk.md`

**What’s happening:**  
This file exists only on your computer at this point. Git hasn’t saved a version of it yet.

---

## Step 2: Save the file (this matters)

- Press **Ctrl + S** (Windows)
- Or turn on **Auto Save** (optional)

**What’s happening:**  
Saving writes the content to disk. Git can only track what’s saved.

**My view:**  
If it’s not saved, it’s not real (yet).

## Step 3: Preview the Markdown (sanity check)

Before committing, it’s worth checking that your Markdown renders properly.

In VS Code:

- Right-click anywhere in the file → **Open Preview**
- Or use:
  - **Ctrl + Shift + V** (preview in the same tab)
  - **Ctrl + K, V** (side-by-side preview)

**What you’re checking:**
- Headings look like headings
- Bullet points are indented correctly
- Bold and italics render as expected

**Important:**  
The editor shows *raw Markdown*.  
The preview shows *what GitHub and blog platforms will render*.

If it looks right in preview, it will look right when published.

---

## Step 4: Check Source Control (see what Git noticed)

- Click the **Source Control** icon (branch symbol)

You should see your new file under **Changes**.

**What you’re looking at:**  
Git is saying: “I can see a new or changed file, but I haven’t recorded it in history.”

---

## Step 5: Stage the file (choose what goes into the commit)

- Next to the file name, click the **+** (Stage Changes)

The file moves from **Changes** → **Staged Changes**.

**What’s happening:**  
Staging is you telling Git: “Yes, include this file in the next snapshot.”

**Why this step exists:**  
So you can commit only the changes you intend — not every random edit in the folder.

---

## Step 6: Write a commit message (name the snapshot)

In the message box, use something like:

- `Add blog post: How VS Code and Git talk to each other`

Then click **Commit**.

**What’s happening:**  
Git creates a permanent snapshot in your repo history.

- Your file is now part of the Git timeline
- You can roll back to this state later
- You’ve created an audit trail of your writing

**My view:**  
A commit is not “publishing”. It’s a **safe save point**.

---

## Step 7 (optional): Push to GitHub (sync to the cloud)

If your repo is connected to GitHub:

- Click **Sync Changes** or **Push**

**What’s happening:**  
Your local commits are copied to GitHub.

This gives you:
- backup
- sharing
- history visible online

---

## A simple mental model

- **Save** = writes to your computer
- **Preview** = checks how it will render
- **Stage** = selects what goes into the snapshot
- **Commit** = creates the snapshot in Git history
- **Push** = copies snapshots to GitHub

Keep that order straight and Git stays calm.

---

## Common mistakes (and how to avoid them)

- **Forgetting to save**
  - Fix: `Ctrl + S` before staging or committing
- **Judging Markdown by the raw editor**
  - Fix: always use Preview before committing
- **Committing too many unrelated changes**
  - Fix: stage only the files you intend
- **Writing vague commit messages**
  - Fix: start with a verb and describe the outcome
- **Assuming commit = pushed**
  - Fix: commit is local; push is separate

---

## Final takeaway

After creating your file, your clean routine is:

1. Save (`Ctrl + S`)
2. Preview (Ctrl + Shift + V)
3. Stage (`+`)
4. Commit (short message)
5. Push (optional)

Do this consistently and you’ll build a tidy, trustworthy writing history.
