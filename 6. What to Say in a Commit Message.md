# What to Say in a Commit Message (Without Overthinking It)

Once you’ve learned how to stage and commit changes, the next question is almost always:

> *What should I actually write in the commit message?*

This post explains how to write **clear, useful commit messages** — without sounding like a developer or overthinking it.

## What a commit message is really for

A commit message is **not**:
- a diary entry
- a technical explanation
- a justification

A commit message **is**:
- a short label for a snapshot
- a way to understand *why* something changed
- a breadcrumb for your future self

Think of it as a **subject line**, not an essay.

---

## The simplest rule that works

Start with a **verb** and describe the **outcome**.

Good examples:
- `Add blog post on selective staging`
- `Update README with Branching Out context`
- `Fix heading structure in staging post`
- `Rename blog files for consistency`

If you do only this, you’re already doing it well.

---

## What you’re answering (implicitly)

Every good commit message answers one question:

> *What changed in this snapshot?*

Not:
- how you did it
- what you thought about it
- what you might do later

Just what changed.

## Commit messages for writing and content

When working with blogs, docs, or notebooks, these patterns work very well:

### Adding content
- `Add blog post: Why Git ignores unsaved changes`
- `Add section on Markdown preview`

### Improving content
- `Clarify staging explanation`
- `Tighten wording in commit workflow post`

### Structural changes
- `Rename blog files for clearer naming`
- `Reorder posts for learning flow`

### Small fixes
- `Fix typos in README`
- `Correct heading levels`

Boring is good here.

---

## What to avoid (common mistakes)

Try not to use:
- `Changes`
- `Update`
- `Stuff`
- `WIP` (unless you really mean it)

These tell you nothing when you look back later.

Also avoid:
- multi-paragraph commit messages for content
- apologising in commit messages
- explaining context that belongs in the blog itself

---

## How long should a commit message be?

Short enough to read in one line.

As a guide:
- 5–12 words is plenty
- If it needs a paragraph, the commit is probably doing too much

**My view:**  
If you struggle to describe the commit, split it into two commits.

---

## A calm mental model

Think of your Git history as a **table of contents**, not a transcript.

Each commit message should make sense when read like this:

- Add initial blog post
- Add VS Code + Git setup guide
- Add selective staging explanation
- Fix wording in staging post

That’s a story you can follow.

---

## A simple commit message checklist

Before committing, ask:

- Does this describe *only* what’s staged?
- Would this make sense in three months’ time?
- Does it start with a clear verb?

If yes → commit.

---

## Final takeaway

You’re not writing commit messages for Git.

You’re writing them for:
- future you
- collaborators
- your own confidence

Clear, boring, intentional messages are exactly right.
